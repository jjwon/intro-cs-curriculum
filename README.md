# intro-cs-curriculum

This project is to help a friend learn computer science, but I figured that putting it on the internet increases accountability for myself, and if I do a good job, maybe I can help others as well.

This curriculum is adapted from UC Berkeley's CS 61A and CS 61B classes, and any other course material I can figure out how to successfully integrate.
