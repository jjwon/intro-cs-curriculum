# Learning about Functions

First, read the chapters 1.1 through 1.5 of [Composing Programs](http://composingprograms.com/).  This will give you an introduction to expressions, assignment, control flow, as well as teaching you how to design functions in a modular, reusable way.

Then, complete [Homework 1](http://cs61a.org/hw/hw01/).  You are not required to complete the challenge problem.  Submit by pushing the completed assignment to your Github repo for this class.

We'll then explore the idea of [higher-order functions](https://github.com/jjwon/intro-cs-curriculum/blob/master/hof.md), and recursion together before preparing to start the [Hog project](http://cs61a.org/proj/hog/).
